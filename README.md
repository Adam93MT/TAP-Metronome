TAP Metronome
===============

Tap Metronome was inspired while I was practicing with the Water Boys a cappella group. We were struggling to stay together, and couldn't all hear the metronome clicks while singing. We needed a way to stay in time, but not rely on being able to hear the clicks.

I designed and built this iOS app as my first full Swift app. I started building it during Hack the North 2016, and refined it in the fall of 2017.
